## About
Iridophore is a curated list of Maltego transforms for conducting OSINT investigations. 
This tool is free, open-source, and is not intended for commercial use.
While some features may require API keys, this project will only support those who offer free-tier services.

## Trivia
Iridophores are the cells in the top layer of a chameleon's skin which give it the ability to change color. 
They do so by *transforming* their shape to reflect different colors of light.

## Version
Iridophore releases will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/). For this specific document, we will refer to the respective components of this triple as <major>.<minor>.<patch>. The version number may have additional information, such as "-alpha.1", "-beta.2" to mark alpha and beta versions for earlier access. Such releases will be considered as "pre-releases".

NumVerify utilizes the [Numbers Verification API](https://numverify.com/) to return location, carrier, and line type data (API key required). 
Iridophore is not responsible for the validity of the data coming from the numbers verification API.
