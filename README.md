At this point you have a couple of options for adding your credentials to ghunt. Perhaps the simplest method is to used the Ghunt Firefox or Google companion extension.
   
The extension is available on the following stores :\

[![Firefox](https://files.catbox.moe/5g2ld5.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghunt-companion/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[![Chrome](https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-uploads/image/WlD8wC6g8khYWPJUsQceQkhXSlv1/UV4C4ybeBTsZt43U4xis.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghunt-companion/dpdcofblfbmmnikcbmmiakkclocadjab)
   
**Warning:** üö®üö®üö® It is fundamentally dangerous to provide your credentials to unfamiliar applications. Best practice here would be to create a separate gmail account used solely for the purpose of ghunt.
