# üö®Security Policy

Ghunt-Maltego is a free and open-source tool which comes with absolutely no warranty; however, we still take your security seriously and wish to implement steps to protect our users. As such, the developer has adopted this security disclosure and response policy to ensure that critical issues are responsibly handled.

## Supported Versions
Ghunt-Maltego releases will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/). For this specific document, we will refer to the respective components of this triple as <major>.<minor>.<patch>. The version number may have additional information, such as "-alpha.1", "-beta.2" to mark alpha and beta versions for earlier access. Such releases will be considered as "pre-releases". Only the current version will be supported.

| Version                          | Supported          | Release Date |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Ghunt-Maltego 1.0.x              | ‚úÖ                | TBD          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability - Private Disclosure Process
Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected security vulnerabilities should be reported privately, to minimize attacks against current users of ghunt-maltego before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be investigated and patched on the next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. This information could be kept entirely internal to the project.  

To report a vulnerability or a security-related issue, please email contact@kodamachameleon.com to inform our team and await for further instructions. Do not report non-security-impacting bugs through this channel. Use GitHub issues instead.

IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities

Keep in mind that we are a small and unsponsored team (aka this isn't our day job), so please be patient with us as we try to respond to each concern.
